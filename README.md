# **Introduction** 

## **Streamlit App**: https://bk-socioeconomicnepal.streamlit.app/

This Streamlit dashboard represents the socio-economic development indicators of Nepal over 20 years(2000-2020) and visualizes how those indicators have changed over time. 

This dashboard is split into three aspects:

1. GDP Growth of Nepal: In this first tab we look at the national economic growth of Nepal from 2000 to 2020. There is a dropdown menu in this tab that displays various visuals of economic growth like GDP, GDP per capita, GNI, and Adjusted Net National Income per capita. The purpose of this visual is to show how much progress the nation has made over the last 20 years and to further dive into some of the reasons that have slowed down economic progress.

2. Lack of Basic Infrastructure: In the second tab we discuss one of the key obstacles in Nepal's economic development which is the lack of basic infrastructure. The first chart shows the population's access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking. The second graph displays expenditure on healthcare(government and out-of-pocket) over the last 20 years. Likewise, the third chart shows urban population's access to cleanly managed drinking water.

3. Lack of Jobs and Youth Outflow: In this tab, we look at some of the employment opportunities and compare the labor force participation over the last 20 years. Likewise, we also look at the youth unemployment data which tells a story of why young people are leaving the country at an alarming rate. Finally, we look at the net migration rate which is the effect of the above factors we see.

## **Data Sources**: The dataset used for this app is from The World Bank. Here's a link to the dataset: https://data.worldbank.org/country/nepal

## **Data Preparation**: 
In terms of data preparation, the csv file from the World Bank Dataset was used for this project. As Nepal is a developing country, there is not a lot of data, so a lot of data available so it had to be cleaned using Python, and the empty values were dropped.

## **Future Work**:
        In terms of future work, this app could be developed by integrating other factors like technology advancement, the impact of COVID, recent development and see if any changes have been made.
